- When I navigate to `/fireworks`, I should see a list all fireworks
- For each firework, list it's name and description
- For each firework, there should be a link that takes me to `/fireworks/<id>` that shows the full description of the firework

- On the individual page, I want to see all of the firework attributes:
  name, description, price, loudnessRating;

- On the individual firework listing, I want to see the font color changed based on the loudness rating of the firework
